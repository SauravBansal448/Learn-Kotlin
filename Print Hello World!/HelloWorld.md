# Print Hello World!!!


```
fun main() {
    println("Hello, World!!!")
}

```
Now let me explain how this works.


- **I line:** Functions are referred as the building blocks of a Kotlin program. All functions in Kotlin start with the keyword **fun** followed by a name of the function **(main),** a list of zero or more comma-separated parameters, an optional return type, and a body. The main() function takes one argument, an Array of Strings.

- **II line: println()** is used to display the message (input) on the output screen.
