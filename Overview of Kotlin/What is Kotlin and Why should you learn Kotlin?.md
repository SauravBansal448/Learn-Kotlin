# What is Kotlin?


- Kotlin was introduced by a very famous Software company called JetBrains (formerly known as IntelliJ Software) in the year 2011, as a new language for JVM.

- Kotlin is a cross-platform, statically typed, general-purpose programming language which means it performs type checking at compile-time as opposed to run-time. It is widely used to develop Android application.

# Why should you learn Kotlin?

Consider writing 10-15 lines of code in Java and write the same code in just 3-4 lines in Kotlin. Which one would you prefer? Java or Kotlin? Definitely Kotlin right? Yes. This is because,

- Kotlin reduces the number of boilerplate codes that are present in Java. These are nothing but the sections of code that has to be included in many places with little or no alterations. 

- Kotlin is very safe to use. By safe, I mean, Kotlin programming language reduces the NullPointerExecptions that occur during the execution of a program.

- Kotlin is Interoperable. This means, existing Java code can be called from Kotlin in a natural way, and also Kotlin code can be used from Java smoothly.
