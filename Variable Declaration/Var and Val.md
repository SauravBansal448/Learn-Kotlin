# var and val in Kotlin

## var and val:

- val and var both are used to declare a variable. 
- var is like general variable and it's known as a mutable variable in kotlin and can be assigned multiple times. 
- val is like **Final variable** and it's known as immutable in kotlin and can be initialized only single time.


Kotlin variable is declared using keyword **var** and **val**.

```
var xyz ="Mobcoder LLC"
val abc = 20
```

Here, variable xyz is String type and variable abc is Int type. Kotlin compiler knows this by initializer expression. This is called type inference in programming. \
You can also explicitly specify the type like this:

```
var xyz : String ="Edureka"
val abc : Int = 20
```

This is how you declare a variable in Kotlin Programming Language.
