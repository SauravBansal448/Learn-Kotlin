# Class and Object in Kotlin

## Kotlin Class: 

- Kotlin class is similar to the Java class. 
- Kotlin classes are declared using the keyword **class**. 
- Kotlin class has a **class header** which specifies its type parameters, constructor, etc. and the class body that is surrounded with curly braces.

#### Syntax:

```
class className{   // Class Header
// Property
// Member function
}

```


## Kotlin Object

- An object is considered as a real-time entity or a logical entity which has state and behavior, where state represents the value of an object and behavior represent the functionality of an object.
- An object is basically used to access the properties and member function of a class. 
- Kotlin allows creating multiple objects of a class.

#### Create an Object

Kotlin object is created in two steps, the first step is to create a reference and then create an object.

 ```
var obj = Classname()

```
Now, this is not the same as Java right? You would instantiate the object using the keyword New which is not used in Kotlin.
